# Arcade
This was my final project for my intro to Computer Science class. For my project, I decided to make not 1, but 3 games put together 
in an arcade. These games are :
1. **PPAP** (Pen-pineapple-apple-pen) - Inspired by the [iPhone game that can be downloaded from iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pineapple-pen/id1159035153?mt=8)
2. **Aa** - Inspired by the [actual game in iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aa/id905852173?mt=8)
3. **Flappy bird** - who doesn't know or love this one?

These three games share a common arcade `Start Screen` from where the player can click on the icon corresponding to the game they want to play. 

### PPAP Game

In this game, the player presses the `S` key to shoot, and tries to hit the apple. Once they reach **10 points** a pineapple is added as well.

The game ends when the player misses **3 times**, taking the player to the `Common name entry screen`.

### Flappy Bird Game

In this game, the player clicks on the trackpad/mouse to make the bird move up. The bird falls if no clicking occurs. The objective of the 
game is to maneuver the bird through the poles. If the bird hits a pole or the ground, the player is taken to the `Common name entry screen`.

### Aa Game

This game is played by clicking on the mouse or trackpad to shoot poles at a spinning orb. If the required amount of poles is attatched to the orb, the player 
moves onto the next level. If a pole hits an already existing pole, the game ends, and the player is taken to the `Common name entry screen`.

> The name and score for that game is stored on a local file.
> The high score for each game is refreshed every time the game is run.
> By clicking the left arrow, the player goes back to the `Common start screen`

By clicking the right arrow, the player goes to the `Leaderboard Screen` where all of the high scores from all time for each game are displayed.
